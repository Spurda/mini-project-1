## Project Description
This is a learning project to build a number guessing mini-game and hoping it works as imagined. 

## Rules
You are on the edge.
Find the number that will save whatever you are hoping for, or be doomed.

The rules are the following:
    - Difficulty is tied to the array in which the number is located and the number of trials allowed.
    - Your 9th sense will tell you if you got it, over or under shoot it. This every time you throw your hope at the inexorable truth.
    - Your previous attemps will only be shown when you are about to lose definitely.
    - Scoring will be held for you to believe you can be the best. Lowest score will be the best.
    - You will be taunted by the all-knowing truth.?
    -
